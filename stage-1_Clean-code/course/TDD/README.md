# Concepts to review:

## Monkey patching

- https://www.audero.it/blog/2016/12/05/monkey-patching-javascript/

Monkey patching is a technique to add, modify, or suppress the default behavior of a piece of code at runtime without changing its original source code.

It has been extensively used in the past by libraries, such as MooTools, and developers to add methods that were missing in JavaScript.
